        <h2>Why You Should Own a Cat</h2>
			<p>Cats are one of those animals that are <strong>nice</strong> to have around with you.
			Cats are <strong>nice</strong> to have around because they can do their own things without you. For
			example, if you are out doing work, cats will just <strong>sleep</strong>. If you have an auto feeder,
			they will get their food on their own. They can also use the bathroom on their <strong>own</strong> as
			long as they have a kitty litter. You as an owner <strong>do not</strong> have to do much besides cleaning
			their area / litter and can play with them occasionally. Another good reason you should own cats is because
			they are <strong>cute</strong>. Some cats are also very <strong>cuddly</strong> and <strong>affectionate</strong>
			depending on their personality. Overall, cats are <strong>nice</strong> to have around and they are <strong>cute</strong>.
